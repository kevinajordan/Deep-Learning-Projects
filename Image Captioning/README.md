# Image Captioning 

This project is from Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree, project 2. 

It implements the research paper, [Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) and uses the MS-COCO dataset.

The CVND-P2-Image Captioning folder is contains my project submission written in PyTorch.

The TF-Image-Captioning folder is written in Tensorflow 2 and implements a pre-trained Model: Inception_ResNet_v2
